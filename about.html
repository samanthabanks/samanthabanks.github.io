<p>
   This is my first official step into coding. I was able to 
   take a coding class in high school 
   but took another path after graduation. 
   I followed my passion for teaching and for working towards making education inclusive
   and accessiable. After ten year in education, I am ready for a change. I'm ready to follow
   a new passion.
</p>
<p>The most vauable skill that I have gain during my time in education is the ability to 
    quickly adapt to a number of changes.
