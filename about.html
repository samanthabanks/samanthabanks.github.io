        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            This is my first official step into coding. Like many people my age, my 
            first experience with HTML was customizing my MySpace page. Learning 
            how to add a music player made me 
            feel like a hacker! It was so exciting. I was able to 
            take a web development class in high school 
            but took another path after graduation. 
            I followed my passion for teaching and for working towards making education inclusive
            and accessible. After ten year in education, 
            I am ready for a change. I'm ready to follow this rekindled passion 
            with code and the tech world. 
        </p>
        <p>The most valuable skill that I have gain during my time in education is the ability to 
            quickly adapt to a number of changes.
